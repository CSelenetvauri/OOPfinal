# University Management System (UMS)

## Overview

This program simulates a University Management System (UMS) that stores and manages student information, along with the courses they are enrolled in. It allows the printing of student details, along with the list of courses they are enrolled in, including each course's properties such as title, prerequisites, and major topics.

## Program Structure

The program is structured into three primary classes:

- **LearningCourse**: Defines the properties of a course.
- **Student**: Defines student properties and their enrolled courses.
- **UMS**: Manages a list of students and provides functionality to print student data and their enrolled courses.

### 1. **LearningCourse Class**

The `LearningCourse` class represents a university course and includes the following fields:

- `title`: The title of the course (String).
- `acceptancePrerequisites`: The prerequisites required for enrolling in the course (String).
- `majorTopics`: The main topics covered in the course (String).

The class also provides the following:

- **Constructors**: To initialize a course with a title, prerequisites, and major topics.
- **Getters and Setters**: For accessing and modifying the course properties.

#### Example:
```java
public class LearningCourse {
    private String title;
    private String acceptancePrerequisites;
    private String majorTopics;

    public LearningCourse(String title, String acceptancePrerequisites, String majorTopics) {
        this.title = title;
        this.acceptancePrerequisites = acceptancePrerequisites;
        this.majorTopics = majorTopics;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }

    public void setTitle(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    public String getAcceptancePrerequisites() {
        return acceptancePrerequisites;
    }

    public void setAcceptancePrerequisites(String acceptancePrerequisites) {
        this.acceptancePrerequisites = acceptancePrerequisites;
    }

    public String getMajorTopics() {
        return majorTopics;
    }

    public void setMajorTopics(String majorTopics) {
        this.majorTopics = majorTopics;
    }
}
```

## 2. Student Class

The `Student` class represents a student and contains:

- `name`: The name of the student (String).
- `learningCourses`: A list of courses that the student is enrolled in (`List<LearningCourse>`).

It also provides:

- **Constructors**: To initialize a student with a name and a list of courses.
- **Getters and Setters**: For accessing and modifying student properties.

### Example:
```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private List<LearningCourse> learningCourses;

    public Student(String name, List<LearningCourse> learningCourses) {
        this.name = name;
        this.learningCourses = learningCourses;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public List<LearningCourse> getLearningCourses() {
        return learningCourses;
    }

    public void setLearningCourses(List<LearningCourse> learningCourses) {
        this.learningCourses = learningCourses;
    }
}
```
## 3. UMS Class

The `UMS` class is the main class that manages a list of students and their enrolled courses. It provides the following functionality:

- **Constructor**: Initializes a list of students.
- **printStudentData(Student student)**: A method that prints out a student's name and all the courses they are enrolled in, including the details of each course (title, prerequisites, and major topics).

The `main` method initializes sample data, including some courses and a student, and then prints out the studentâ€™s data.

### Example:
```java
public class UMS {
    private List<Student> students;

    public UMS(List<Student> students) {
        this.students = students;
    }

    public void printStudentData(Student student) {
        System.out.println("Student Name: " + student.getName());
        System.out.println("Courses enrolled: ");
        
        for (LearningCourse course : student.getLearningCourses()) {
            System.out.println("Course Title: " + course.getTitle());
            System.out.println("Acceptance Prerequisites: " + course.getAcceptancePrerequisites());
            System.out.println("Major Topics: " + course.getMajorTopics());
            System.out.println("");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LearningCourse course1 = new LearningCourse("Object Oriented Programming", "CS50 Introduction to Programming", "Java syntax and data structures, Procedural programming, Classes, Polymorphism, Packages, ETC");
        LearningCourse course2 = new LearningCourse("Computer Organization", "CS50 Introduction to Programming", "Representing and manipulating information, Machine-level representations of programs, Optimizing program performance, The memory hierarchy");
        LearningCourse course3 = new LearningCourse("English Language Course C1-2", "English Language Course C1-1", "English for Academic Purposes, Reading skills, Speaking skills");
        LearningCourse course4 = new LearningCourse("Mathematical Foundation of Computing", "MATH 150 Calculus I, CS50 Introduction to Programming", "Mathematical Logic, Discrete Mathematics, Sets and Graph Theory, Combinatorics, Digital Systems");
        LearningCourse course5 = new LearningCourse("Calculus II", "MATH150 Calculus I", "Antiderivatives, Definite integrals, Techniques and applications of integration, Improper integrals, Infinite series");

        Student student1 = new Student("Elene Tvauri", Arrays.asList(course1, course2, course3, course4, course5));

        UMS ums = new UMS(Arrays.asList(student1));
        ums.printStudentData(student1);
    }
}
```
